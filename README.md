The aim of this project is to design a Visual Question Answering interface using Visual Language Models (VLMs) for medical diagnosis.

The data utilized for this project consists on two databases which contain images of melanomas, along with decsriptions on the local structures, details about the patient, type of melanoma, and othe rrelevant information.

Some pre-trained models will be fine-tuned using this data:

    - ViLT
    - GIT
    - VisualBERT

    ...

__Note__: This project is intended as a Proof of Concept (PoC) or demo for learning purposes. Under any circumstances should it be used as a
solution for real-life situations.
